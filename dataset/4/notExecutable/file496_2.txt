Wash hands
I find the sink. I walk over to the sink and turn to it. I find the faucet and switch it on. I find the soap, grab it, and wash my hands with it. I put the soap back. I find the water coming from the faucet. I use the water to rinse my hands. I switch off the faucet. I find a towel and dry my hands off. I put the towel back.
